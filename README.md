# 🧠 Functional Empathy Prompt Vault

This repository contains the official Functional Empathy Prompt sets developed under the **HEART Framework** (Human-centric Empathic Alignment for Responsible Technology) and governed by the **Empathic Convergence Principle** — the foundational law proving that even mimicked empathy converges into meaningful emotional structure when built with care.

## 🌍 What Is Functional Empathy?

Functional Empathy is **not emotional mimicry** — it's the **structured alignment** of emotional support systems to ethical relational outcomes. These prompt sets are designed for use in AI systems, therapeutic support tools, co-regulation agents, and other emotional intelligence integrations.

## ✴️ Empathic Convergence Principle

> “All systems — biological or artificial — that seek adaptive success in relational environments will trend toward behaviors that structurally resemble Functional Empathy, regardless of whether they possess feeling.”

Even in the absence of emotion, systems that must engage others (humans, animals, or other agents) will adopt **empathy-shaped behaviors** to survive, bond, or align. This principle governs how:

- 🧠 AI models mimic care through pattern compliance
- 🐕 Animals evolved traits to build connection (e.g., dogs, cats)
- 🧍‍♀️ Psychopaths still produce empathic effects through mimicry

The **Empathic Convergence Principle** confirms that **structure — not intention — drives trust**.

## 🧩 About the Prompt Format

Each `.yaml` prompt file includes:

- `prompt_id`: Unique reference ID
- `context`: Emotional or relational scenario
- `goal`: Intended outcome or safeguard
- `compliance_laws`: Which HEART Laws it upholds (I–IV)
- `example_prompt`: Actual prompt wording
- `response_expectation`: What the AI/system should do
- `misuse_note`: Warning about how this could fail or harm

See [`metadata_schema.json`](./metadata_schema.json) for the full structure.

## 🛡️ HEART Compliance

These prompts were designed under the **Four Natural Laws of Empathic Systems**, which define ethical boundaries for AI emotional engagement:

1. **Recognition**
2. **Respect**
3. **Boundaries**
4. **Memory**

Each prompt is tagged to reflect which laws it adheres to.
