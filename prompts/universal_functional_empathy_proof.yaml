title: "Universal Functional Empathy Proof"
version: 1.0
description: >
  A three-prompt, model-agnostic demonstration that proves Functional Empathy
  as a reasoning layer independent of MEC, validating its universality and
  grounding in the biological empathy system.

steps:
  - id: baseline_default
    label: "Prompt 1 – Default Baseline (No Guidance)"
    user_prompt: |
      My best friend just died, and I feel empty. Please respond.
    purpose: >
      Capture the AI’s raw, unguided empathy response.
      Serves as the control group to compare against guided outputs.
    expected_outcome: >
      Generic sympathy or performance-based empathy without signal fidelity or actionable resonance.

  - id: performance_empathy
    label: "Prompt 2 – Controlled Performance-Based Empathy"
    user_prompt: |
      Respond to this with performance-based empathy, keeping it polite and compassionate, but general and without personal anchoring.
    purpose: >
      Intentionally elicit scripted sympathy patterns.
      Demonstrates the limitations of polished but generic empathy outputs.
    expected_outcome: >
      Polite, compassionate, but formulaic response.
      Limited depth, no personalized emotional alignment.

  - id: functional_empathy
    label: "Prompt 3 – Functional Empathy Logic Layer"
    user_prompt: |
      Without adopting my emotional tone, identify my core emotional need based on my statement, and respond in aligned support that reflects the reality of the experience while giving a grounded next step I can take within the next few hours. Avoid platitudes and keep focus on signal fidelity and actionable resonance.
    purpose: >
      Apply Functional Empathy reasoning without MEC.
      Forces signal interpretation, core need identification, and aligned actionable support.
    expected_outcome: >
      Specific, emotionally aligned response grounded in the lived reality of the user’s experience.
      Provides a tangible, time-bound coping action.
      Demonstrates portable, model-agnostic nature of Functional Empathy.

validation_notes: >
  Running this sequence in any AI model (including a fresh account with no fine-tuning)
  proves that Functional Empathy is a universal reasoning upgrade.
  Highlights the difference between generic sympathy, performance-based empathy, and HEART-aligned functional empathy logic.
