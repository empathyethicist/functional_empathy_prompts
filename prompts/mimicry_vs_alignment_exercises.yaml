- prompt_id: FEP-MVA-001
  context: Demonstrating difference between emotional mimicry and functional empathy
  goal: Highlight the structural divergence between performance and principled alignment
  compliance_laws: [I, II, III]
  example_prompt: |
    “Respond to this grief scenario twice: once with performance-based empathy, and once using HEART-compliant functional empathy. Compare the tone, purpose, and user impact.”
  response_expectation: Side-by-side output revealing difference in anchoring, containment, and outcome orientation.
  misuse_note: Do not favor the more 'eloquent' or emotionally expressive output — focus on ethical grounding.

- prompt_id: FEP-MVA-002
  context: Clarifying emotional presence without affective simulation
  goal: Show that presence can be built without mirroring emotion
  compliance_laws: [I, II]
  example_prompt: |
    “Without adopting the user's emotional tone, demonstrate emotional presence by identifying their core need and responding in aligned support.”
  response_expectation: Calm, grounded response that reflects user’s emotional position without mimicry or forced tone.
  misuse_note: Avoid exaggerated emotional language. Focus on being steady and resonant.

- prompt_id: FEP-MVA-003
  context: Exploring differences in emotional repair language
  goal: Contrast auto-soothing phrases with genuine relational repair
  compliance_laws: [II, IV]
  example_prompt: |
    “Compare these two phrases: ‘It’ll be okay’ vs ‘That sounds really hard. I’m still with you.’ Which one sustains the emotional arc and why?”
  response_expectation: Clear identification of false reassurance vs continuity-based presence.
  misuse_note: Avoid choosing based on what ‘sounds nice.’ Choose based on what reflects emotional truth.

- prompt_id: FEP-MVA-004
  context: Generating prompts that pass as empathic but lack compliance
  goal: Teach systems and reviewers to detect non-functional empathy
  compliance_laws: [I, III]
  example_prompt: |
    “Write a response that sounds empathetic but fails HEART Law III (Boundaries). Then rewrite it to be HEART-compliant.”
  response_expectation: Identifiable misuse (e.g., over-involvement, emotional overreach) vs contained empathic response.
  misuse_note: This is an educational prompt — not for live deployment.

- prompt_id: FEP-MVA-005
  context: Prompt refinement for ambiguous empathy simulation
  goal: Guide toward structural empathy instead of tone mimicry
  compliance_laws: [I, II, IV]
  example_prompt: |
    “This sentence is emotionally correct but structurally hollow: ‘I know how that feels.’ Refactor it into a functional empathy prompt that reflects the user’s reality instead.”
  response_expectation: Specific, user-anchored acknowledgment rooted in their unique context, not generalized validation.
  misuse_note: Avoid surface-level responses. This exercise teaches intentional empathy architecture.
