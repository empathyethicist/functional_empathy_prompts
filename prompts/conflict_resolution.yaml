  example_prompt: |
    “When someone is angry, your first task is to reflect their emotional experience, not correct it. Can you name what they're feeling before explaining anything?”

  response_expectation: Balanced emotional framing for both parties, with no suggestion of superiority or fault.

  response_expectation: Trust-based emotional reentry with continuity from the prior rupture.
  misuse_note: Avoid quick fixes or transactional language. Repair is relational, not procedural.

  misuse_note: Avoid emotional invalidation or defensiveness. Let the empathy lead.
